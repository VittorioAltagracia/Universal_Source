The project is still in development (as of June 2023) but it is mostly done.

# Universal Source

# The idea
The information is scattered around the web and often available mostly in English and Spanish. People have to ask on Facebook groups and just try to figure it out somehow. I want to change that by creating a software solution aimed to help Ukrainian-speaking immigrants (and everyone else who speaks English and/or other languages)

 As well as people who generally want to have a source of truth for most common questions a ‘newcomer’ may have
